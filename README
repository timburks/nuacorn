HOW TO USE THIS
---------------

If you have Nu and Acorn installed, just type "nuke install" in the NuAcorn top-level directory.

That will install the NuAcorn plugin, which adds three demonstration commands.

	1. Filter->Nu->Grayscale
	2. Filter->Color->Make Grayscale (Nu)
	3. Filter->Add Gray Border

See the acorn.nu source file for details.
	
Also, if you're experienced with Nu, the familiar Nu console is installed under the Acorn Window menu.

If you want to have some fun with it, open it and type the following, replacing "/Users/tim/Desktop" with the path to your local NuAcorn directory:
	(load "/Users/tim/Desktop/NuAcorn/examples/add_red_border.nu")

But if that's too much work for you, there's an even easier way to add plugins at runtime; check out the "Nu->Load Plugin from File..." menu item.
